Title: Build a Real Estate Web Application with Next.js, Shadcn UI, Supabase, and NextAuth

Description:
company name : AQARHUB EGYPT
Create a modern, scalable, and user-friendly real estate web application using Next.js as the framework. The app should utilize Shadcn UI for styling components, Supabase for database management and backend services, and NextAuth for authentication. Ensure the application follows best practices for performance, security, and maintainability.


Features to Include:

User Authentication:
Implement user registration and login functionality using NextAuth.
Support authentication providers such as Google, GitHub, and email/password.
Allow users to reset their passwords.
Property Listings:
Create a CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) system for property listings.
Use Supabase to store property data, including fields like title, description, price, location, images, and availability status.
Enable filtering and sorting of properties based on criteria such as price range, location, and type (e.g., apartment, house, land).
Responsive Design:
Use Shadcn UI components to ensure a consistent and visually appealing design across all devices.
Make the application fully responsive for desktop, tablet, and mobile users.
Search Functionality:
Add a search bar that allows users to search for properties by keywords, location, or other filters.
Provide autocomplete suggestions for locations or property types.
User Profiles:
Allow registered users to create and manage their profiles.
Users should be able to view their saved properties, submitted listings, and account settings.
Admin Dashboard:
Create an admin panel where administrators can manage all property listings, user accounts, and site settings.
Use role-based access control (RBAC) to restrict certain actions to admin users only.
Image Uploads:
Integrate Supabase Storage to allow users to upload multiple images for each property listing.
Display these images in a gallery format on the property detail page.
SEO Optimization:
Implement server-side rendering (SSR) and static site generation (SSG) where appropriate to improve SEO.
Generate dynamic metadata for property pages to enhance visibility in search engines.
Error Handling and Validation:
Add robust form validation for inputs such as property details and user information.
Handle errors gracefully and provide meaningful feedback to users.
Deployment:
Set up deployment configurations for Vercel or another hosting platform.
Include environment variables for Supabase keys, NextAuth secrets, and other sensitive data.
Tech Stack:

Frontend: Next.js with Shadcn UI
Backend: Supabase (PostgreSQL database, API endpoints, and storage)
Authentication: NextAuth.js
Styling: Tailwind CSS (via Shadcn UI)
Deliverables:

A complete Next.js project structure with all necessary files and folders.
Functional components for each feature listed above.
Comprehensive README file explaining how to set up and run the application locally.
Example data seeded into Supabase for testing purposes.
Additional Notes:

Follow clean code principles and modularize the codebase for better maintainability.
Write unit tests for critical components and APIs if possible.
Ensure the application adheres to accessibility standards (WCAG 2.1 AA compliance).
